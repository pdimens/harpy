## üì• Install 
To avoid dependency conflicts with an existing environment, it is best to create a new environment for a harpy installation. The code below creates a new conda/mamba environment called `harpy` (via `-n harpy`) and installs harpy into it. You can name this environment whatever you like using the `-n somename` argument. 
```bash
mamba create -n harpy -c bioconda -c conda-forge harpy
```

If you wish to install harpy and its dependencies into an existing environment, activate that environment (`conda activate env_name`) and execute this installation code:
```bash
mamba install -c bioconda -c conda-forge harpy
```
Or provide `-n envname` to install it into an existing environment named `envname`
```bash
mamba install -n envname -c bioconda -c conda-forge harpy
```

---

</details>

## üåü Activate the harpy environment
Once conda/mamba finishes, activate the conda/mamba environment you installed harpy into with
```bash
conda activate env_name
```
where `env_name` is the name of that environment. After doing so, the `harpy` executable should be callable from your path.


## ‚ö° Usage
Just call `harpy` or `harpy --help` on the command line to get started!
```bash
harpy
```
