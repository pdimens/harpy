===

Harpy is hosted on [Bioconda](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/harpy), which means you just need to have either  `conda` or `pixi` (or `docker`) on your Unix-like 
system to install it.

+++ üêç Conda
It's best to create a new environment for a harpy installation. The code below creates a new conda/mamba environment called `harpy` (via `-n harpy`) and installs harpy into it. You can name this environment whatever you like using the `-n somename` argument. 
```bash
conda create -n harpy -c bioconda -c conda-forge harpy
```

Once conda/mamba finishes, activate the harpy conda/mamba environment with:
```bash
conda activate env_name
```
where `env_name` is the name of that environment. After doing so, the `harpy` executable should be callable from your path.

==- ‚¨áÔ∏è install as local conda environment
Alternatively, you can create the environment locally within a specific project folder, just swap `-n harpy` for
`-p path/to/workdir/harpy`, which creates the environment in that specific folder (e.g. `potato_blight/harpy`).
```
conda create -p path/to/workdir/harpy -c bioconda -c conda-forge harpy
```
==- ‚¨áÔ∏è install into existing conda environment
 
If you wish to install harpy and its dependencies into an existing environment, activate that environment and execute this installation code:
```bash
conda activate env_name
conda install -c conda-forge bioconda::harpy
```
Or provide `-n env_name` to install it into an existing environment named `env_name`
```bash
conda install -n env_name -c conda-forge bioconda::harpy
```
==- ‚¨ÜÔ∏è updating harpy

Activate the environment and run `conda update`:

```bash
conda update -c conda-forge bioconda::harpy
```
===

### ‚ö° Conda Usage
Activate the conda environment with Harpy and call `harpy` or `harpy --help` on the command line to get started
```bash activate the environment
conda activate harpy_env

# or, if installed locally
conda activate path/to/harpy_env
```

```bash call harpy
harpy
```

+++ üåü Pixi

If you prefer [Pixi](https://pixi.sh/latest/) (it's pretty good, you should try it), you can
install Harpy to be accessible in your PATH, i.e. a "global" installation:

```bash
pixi global install -c conda-forge -c bioconda harpy
```
!!! add pixi to PATH
Make sure `~/.pixi/bin` is in your PATH:
```bash ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc (or equivalent) 
export PATH=~/.pixi/bin:$PATH
```
!!!

==- ‚¨áÔ∏è install as local environment

Likewise, you can do an installation into a local project directory:

```bash
pixi init -c conda-forge -c bioconda projectname && cd projectname
pixi add harpy
```

==- ‚¨ÜÔ∏è updating harpy

If installed via Pixi, you can update Harpy with `pixi update`:
```bash
# global install
pixi global update harpy

# local install
# project dir has the pixi.toml file
cd path/to/projectdir
pixi update harpy
```
===

### ‚ö° Pixi Usage
If installed globally, just call `harpy` or `harpy --help` on the command line, otherwise navigate to the directory with the pixi environment and call harpy from within it:
```bash call harpy if installed globally
# installed globally
harpy
```
```bash call harpy if installed locally
# navigate to project directory
cd path/to/workdir

# activate the pixi environment and run harpy
pixi shell
harpy

# or prepend `pixi run` to it without activating the environment
pixi run harpy
```

+++ üì¶ Containers
If you didn't know, packages on Bioconda are automatically built as containers too!
Use one of the two approaches below then proceed to use containerized-Harpy however
you are used to using containers on your system.

==- üê≥ Docker
Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
```bash
docker pull quay.io/biocontainers/harpy
```

==- üÖ∞Ô∏è Apptainer
Apptainer is Linux-only, but can be used inside a Windows WSL. Find the most recent tag [here](https://quay.io/repository/biocontainers/harpy?tab=tags) and replace `$TAG` with it or use the `TAG=$(curl ...)` part below to pull the latest version name using the repository's API.
```bash
TAG=$(curl -s "https://quay.io/api/v1/repository/biocontainers/harpy/tag/" | cut -d'"' -f6)
apptainer pull docker://quay.io/biocontainers/harpy:$TAG
```
===

+++ üí£ Pip
This is the "all else fails" solution and generally not recommended. You can install Harpy locally via `pip`, however, it can
only get so far as installing the Python package dependencies and not the other software, which you will need to install manually
if it's not already on your system.

!!!danger
The problem is, if you get Harpy installed this way, you will need to use `--container` for the workflows, since otherwise
it would use Conda, which we're assuming isn't available to your system (otherwise you would have installed Harpy using it).
If you're on a Linux system, that should be fine. However, if you're on a macOS system, the container software, `Apptainer`, isn't available
for macOS (or Windows), meaning you won't be able to use most of Harpy.
!!!

=== Download the latest release
The latest release can be found [here](https://github.com/pdimens/harpy/releases/latest). You will want to download the latest
tarball, which will be named `harpy.VERISON.tar.gz`. Something like `https://github.com/pdimens/harpy/releases/download/2.5.0/harpy.2.5.0.tar.gz`.

```bash
# change the version number to the latest release!
wget https://github.com/pdimens/harpy/releases/download/2.5.0/harpy.2.5.0.tar.gz
tar xvfz harpy.2.5.0.tar.gz
cd harpy.2.5.0
```

==- Install Harpy using `pip`
```bash
python -m pip install .
```

If for some reason it's fussing when you try that command, you can attempt this method:
```bash
python3 -m pip install --upgrade build && python3 -m build && \
    pip install dist/*.whl
```

==- Install the bundled scripts
Harpy needs all the scripts in the `harpy/bin` folder installed too. You will need to copy them into some kind of folder
on your PATH (e.g. `/usr/local/bin` or `~/.local/bin`). If you don't understand what that means, see [this resource](https://www.howtogeek.com/658904/how-to-add-a-directory-to-your-path-in-linux/).

```bash
chmod +x harpy/bin/*
cp harpy/bin/* path/to/the/folder
```

==- Install the remaining software
Unfortunately, you will still need to install the remaining non-Python software, listed below with their minimum version numbers in
parentheses. With any luck, your system might have one of more of them already installed! 
- bcftools (>=1.22)
- htslib (>=1.22)
- samtools (>=1.22)

All three of `bcftools`, `samtools`, and `htslib` can be installed as [described here](https://www.htslib.org/download/).

- seqtk
```
git clone https://github.com/lh3/seqtk.git;
cd seqtk; make
```

==- ‚¨ÜÔ∏è updating harpy
Updating Harpy installed this way would require repeating the steps with a different Harpy version.
===

### ‚ö° Pip Usage
You should be able to call `harpy` from your command line:
```bash
harpy
```
